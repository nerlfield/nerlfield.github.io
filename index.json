Each particle is described by:\nType: Represented by an integer, indicating the particle\u0026rsquo;s category. Position: A vector that denotes the particle\u0026rsquo;s coordinates in space. Velocity: A vector that reflects the particle\u0026rsquo;s speed and direction. The crux of Particle Life lies in the interactions between particles, which are influenced by their type and proximity. These interactions are quantified by an attraction matrix, which, along with the distance between particles, determines the forces of attraction or repulsion.\nMathematical Underpinnings The mathematical framework of Particle Life is both elegant and simple. Consider two particles, (i) and (j), with positions $\\vec{p}_i$ and $\\vec{p}_j$. The force (F) exerted on particle (i) by particle (j) is given by:\n$$F(\\vec{p}_i, \\vec{p}_j, A_{ij}) = A_{ij} \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{|\\vec{p}_i - \\vec{p}_j|}{R_{max}}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{p}_j - \\vec{p}_i}{|\\vec{p}_j - \\vec{p}_i|}$$\nHere:\n$A_{ij}$ is the attraction factor from the attraction matrix for particles (i) and (j). (f) is a function that modulates the force based on the normalized distance, scaled by the maximum interaction radius $R_{max}$. The direction vector is normalized to ensure the force is directed towards particle (j). Implementation Overview Particle Life\u0026rsquo;s adaptability is clear in its various complex implementations. Choosing the right force function (f) and attraction matrix (A) is crucial for creating a range of patterns from simple beginnings.\nReference Implementation Visit github.com/nerlfield/particle-life for a reference implementation.
